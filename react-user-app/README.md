# React User table

This application is built using React for the view, React Router for routing, and dummy data pulled from this [API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) for user information.  PatternFly styling is used for the individual user view, with custom state management for handling user interaction.

Jest is used for testing.
