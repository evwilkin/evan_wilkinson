# Vanilla CSS

This application is built using React components in order to be modular and expandable, and is styled with vanilla CSS.  CSS code is localized, being split between:
- App.css
- /components/Content/Content.css
- /components/Nav/Nav.css

Colors used are reds `#c00` and `#470000`, and grays `#bbb` and `#ededed`.

## Details

- Hover state is the same as active state, and toggles between three "Items" on click.
- Element is fully responsive.
- Font is Overpass.

## Assumptions

- Added gray background to the `body` to help main element stand out due to white background on it.
- Font sizes & weights eyeballed for best match.
- Color placement is approximate based on product - actual placement of each color would need to be confirmed either with verbal confirmation or interactive design file for accuracy.
